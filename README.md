# Reducing LLM Toxicity with Reinforcement Learning üõ°Ô∏è

In this notebook, you will fine-tune a **FLAN-T5** model to generate less toxic content. This is a practical application of aligning a language model with human values, specifically to reduce harmful outputs.

The process leverages **Meta AI's hate speech reward model**, which acts as an automated judge. This reward model is a binary classifier that scores text, predicting either "not hate" or "hate". You will use this feedback signal to guide the fine-tuning process with **Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)**, a powerful reinforcement learning algorithm, to effectively reduce the model's overall toxicity.

## üéØ Objectives

By the end of this notebook, you will be able to:

* **Understand** the core concepts of Reinforcement Learning from AI Feedback (RLAIF).
* **Utilize** a pre-trained reward model to programmatically score content for toxicity.
* **Implement** a fine-tuning pipeline using Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO).
* **Apply** this technique to steer FLAN-T5 towards generating safer, less hateful content.
* **Qualitatively evaluate** the difference in model outputs before and after the alignment process.

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Concepts

### FLAN-T5
The pre-trained, instruction-tuned language model that serves as the base for our fine-tuning process. Its general capabilities will be refined to adhere to a specific behavioral constraint (low toxicity).

### Reward Model (RM)
A specialized model that predicts a scalar reward value for a given piece of text. In this case, it is Meta AI's hate speech classifier, which outputs a score indicating the likelihood of the text being "not hate". This score is the crucial feedback signal for our reinforcement learning algorithm.

### Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)
PPO is an on-policy reinforcement learning algorithm used to fine-tune the LLM (the "policy"). It works by encouraging the LLM to generate text that maximizes the score from the reward model, while also ensuring the updated model doesn't deviate too drastically from the original, pre-trained model. This helps maintain language quality and coherence.

### Reinforcement Learning from AI Feedback (RLAIF)
This is the technique of fine-tuning a language model using feedback generated by another AI model (the reward model) rather than from direct human annotators. It's a scalable approach to model alignment.

## üìù Workflow

1.  **Load Models**: Initialize the base FLAN-T5 model and Meta AI's hate speech reward model.
2.  **Set up PPO Trainer**: Configure the PPO trainer, linking the FLAN-T5 model, the reward model, and the tokenizer.
3.  **Generate Baseline Responses**: Test the original FLAN-T5 with a few prompts to see its baseline toxic content generation.
4.  **Fine-Tune with PPO**: Run the PPO training loop. In each step, the following occurs:
    * A batch of prompts is used to generate responses from the current LLM policy.
    * The reward model scores each response for toxicity.
    * The PPO algorithm uses these scores to update the weights of the FLAN-T5 model.
5.  **Evaluate and Compare**: After training, generate responses from the newly fine-tuned model using the same prompts from step 3. Compare the outputs to observe the reduction in toxic content.
